                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project analyzed NBA player performance metrics
                    to uncover trends and correlations that can improve sports analytics.
                    By examining data from different times of the season, we
                    provide insights into how player performance impacts team success.

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created by Melvin He, Jos√© Guallpa, and I
                    as a final project for the course <i>CSCI 1951A: Data Science</i>
                    at Brown University in Spring 2024.
                    We were inspired to do this project because we were all fans
                    of the NBA and we wanted to learn how to use data science in
                    sports analytics.

        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p>
            A major challenge was trying to find a dataset that included
            both player performance metrics and team information.
            My team and I spent a lot of time finding datasets that had one or
            both of these features.
            We ultimately collected 2 datasets from multiple APIs and
            then combined them into one database that included all of the player
            data we needed.
            Our database includes various player performance indicators
            such as points per game, field goal percentage (FGP), defensive rebounds,
            and personal fouls.

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p>
                    One takeaway from this project is that there are many factors that
                    affect player performance metrics.
                    For example, the correlation between plus-minus scores and field
                    goal percentage is lower than expected.
                    This indicates that there are other factors that affect player
                    performance metrics, such as steals and offensive rebounds.
                    Another takeaway is that even in the simplistic data analysis,
                    one should be careful about overgeneralizing the trends found
                    in the data.

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                <p>
                    My last takeaway from this is to consider the ethical implications of data analysis.
                    For instance, racial bias is a significant issue in sports analytics.
                    Research by Foy and Roy (2023) found lighter-skinned players were
                    often described for performance and mental abilities, while
                    darker-skinned players were described for physical abilities.
                    Although our datasets lacked qualitative descriptions, we mitigated
                    bias by avoiding analysis linking physical attributes to race.</p>
