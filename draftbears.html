                    <p>
                        This project analyzed NBA player performance metrics
                        to uncover trends and correlations that can improve sports analytics.
                        By examining data from different times of the season, we
                        provide insights into how player performance impacts team success.

                    <p>
                        This project was created by Melvin He, Jos√© Guallpa, and I
                        as a final project for the course CSCI 1951A: Data Science
                        at Brown University in Spring 2024.
                        We were inspired to do this project because we were all fans
                        of the NBA and we wanted to learn how to use data science in
                        sports analytics.

            <h2>Research Process</h2>
            <p>
                First, my group and I had to decide what we wanted to analyze.
                We wanted to find a dataset that included player performance metrics
                and team information, so we could analyze how player performance
                impacts team success.
                Then, we had to develop the research question that would guide our
                analysis.
                We decided to focus on the following question:
                "How do player performance metrics impact team success?"
                We then broke this question down into 3 hypotheses that we could
                test with our data:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The higher the plus-minus score, the better the player performs
                    in terms of scoring efficiency (higher FG%)
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no significant difference in the FG% of players in March compared to their average
                    FG% over the season
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no significant correlation between the number of
                    DRBs and PFs committed by players.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                A major challenge was trying to find a dataset that included
                both player performance metrics and team information.
                My team and I spent a lot of time finding datasets that had one or
                both of these features.
                We ultimately collected 2 datasets from multiple APIs and
                then combined them into one database that included all of the player
                data we needed.
                Our database included various player performance metrics
                such as points per game, FG%, DRBs, and PFs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After collecting the data, we had to clean it up and
                prepare it for analysis.
                We removed any records of players with missing or null values
                to ensure data integrity and completeness.
                We then ran multiple statistical tests on our data
                to assess our hypotheses.

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>
                <span style="color: lime;">Hypothesis 1: Accepted</span><br>
                Strong positive correlation found between plus-minus scores
                and FG%
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Interpretation</b>:
                    We think that this is the case because if someone has a higher
                    field goal percentage, they are likely to score more points
                    which would make their plus-minus score higher

                No significant difference found in players' FG% in March vs entire season

                    <b>Interpretation</b>:
                    We theorize this may be the case due to continuous training,
                    coaching consistency, and player experience

                Positive correlation found between DRB and PF

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Interpretation</b>:
                    We think this link exists because players who are more aggressive
                    on defense are more likely to get rebounds and more likely to commit fouls

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project deepened my understanding of how complex
                        and nuanced data analysis can be.
                        For example, the correlation between plus-minus scores
                        and FG% was lower than expected, revealing that many
                        other factors, such as steals and rebounds, influence
                        player performance metrics.
                        I also learned that even with straightforward datasets,
                        it's important to avoid overgeneralizing trends.
                        Overall, this project reinforced the importance of
                        mindful and cautious analysis as I build AI and ML models
                        in order to accurately reflect the real-world data.

                    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another key takeaway was the importance of considering
                        ethical implications in data analysis.
                        In sports analytics, racial bias remains a serious concern;
                        for example, research by Foy and Roy (2023) highlighted how
                        lighter-skinned players are often praised for cognitive abilities,
                        while darker-skinned players are described more by physical traits.
                        Although our dataset lacked qualitative descriptions,
                        we took care to mitigate bias by avoiding analysis that
                        linked physical attributes to race.
                        As I continue working with AI and ML, maintaining ethical standards
                        will be crucial to creating fair, inclusive, and trustworthy systems.
