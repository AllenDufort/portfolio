                <p>
                    This project analyzed NBA player performance metrics
                    to uncover trends and correlations that can improve sports analytics.
                    By examining data from different times of the season, we aim to
                    provide insights into how player performance impacts team success.

                <h3>Context</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was created by Allen Dufort, Melvin He,
                    and Jos√© Guallpa as a final project for the course CS 1951A:
                    Data Science at Brown University in Spring 2024.
                    We were inspired because we are all fans of the NBA and
                    wanted to explore the statistics behind the game.
                    Additionally, we wanted to learn how to use data science in
                    sports analytics.

        <h2>Research Process</h2>
        <p>
            A major challenge was trying to find a dataset that included
            both player performance metrics and team information.
            My team and I spent a lot of time finding datasets that had one or
            both of these features.
            We ultimately collected 2 datasets from multiple APIs and
            then combined them into one database that included all of the player
            data we needed.
            Our database includes various player performance indicators
            such as points per game, field goal percentage (FGP), defensive rebounds,
            and personal fouls.
        </p>

        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Players with higher plus-minus scores
                tend to have a higher FGP.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Plus-minus score is difference between
                        points scored by team and points scored by
                        opposing team while player is on court
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no significant difference
                in the FGP of players in
                March compared to their season average.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a correlation between the number of defensive rebounds
                and personal fouls committed by players.
            </li>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
            One takeaway from this project is that there are many factors that
            affect player performance metrics.
            For example, the correlation between plus-minus scores and field
            goal percentage is lower than expected (0.179).
            This indicates that there are other factors that affect player
            performance metrics, such as steals and offensive rebounds.
            Another takeaway is that even in the simplistic data analysis,
            one should be careful about overgeneralizing the trends found
            in the data.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" id="ethics">
        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            The last takeaway is to always consider the ethical implications of
            the data analysis.
            For example, racial bias is a major issue in sports analytics.
            Research from Foy and Roy (2023) showed that
            lighter-skinned basketball players were more likely to be
            described for their performance and mental abilities,
            while darker-skinned players were more likely to be described
            for their physical abilities.
            Although the datasets we collected did not include qualitative descriptions,
            we still tried to mitigate bias by ensuring that our analysis
            did not focus on the relationship between physical attributes and race.
