            <h3>Project Description</h3>
            <p>
                Draftbook Sportbooks is a project that analyzed NBA player
                performance metrics.
                This project, created by Melvin He, Jos√© Guallpa, and me, was a
                final project for CSCI 1951A: Data Science at Brown University
                in Spring 2024.
                Motivated by our shared interests in the NBA and sports analytics,
                we examined data from various points in the season to provide
                insights into how individual player performance impacts their
                teams' success.
            </p>

            <h2>Research Process</h2>
            <p>
                Our research question was:
                "How do player performance metrics impact team success?"
                We then broke this question down into 3 hypotheses
                that we could test:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The higher the plus-minus score, the better the player performs
                    in terms of scoring efficiency (higher field goal (FG)%)
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no significant difference in the FG% of players in March compared to their average
                    FG% over the season
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is no significant correlation between the number of
                    DRBs and PFs committed by players.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                One challenge during research was trying to find a dataset that
                included both player performance metrics and team information.
                To solve this issue, we collected data from two APIs and
                then combined it into one database with multiple tables.
                Our database included various player performance metrics
                such as FG%, defensive rebounds (DRB), and personal fouls (PFs).
            </p>
            <p>
                After collecting the data, we cleaned the data and ran multiple
                statistical tests on our data to assess our hypotheses.

                            field goal percentage, they are likely to score more points
                            which would make their plus-minus score higher

                            on defense are more likely to get rebounds and more likely to commit fouls

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                This project deepened my understanding of how complex
                and nuanced data analysis can be.
                For example, the correlation between plus-minus scores
                and FG% was lower than expected, revealing that many
                other factors, such as steals and rebounds, influence
                player performance metrics.
                I also learned that even with straightforward datasets,
                it's important to avoid overgeneralizing trends.
                Overall, this project reinforced the importance of
                mindful and cautious analysis as I build AI and ML models
                in order to accurately reflect the real-world data.
