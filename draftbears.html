                    <p>
                        This project analyzed NBA player performance metrics
                        to uncover trends and correlations that can improve sports analytics.
                        By examining data from different times of the season, we
                        provide insights into how player performance impacts team success.

                    <p>
                        This project was created by Melvin He, José Guallpa, and I
                        as a final project for the course <i>CSCI 1951A: Data Science</i>
                        at Brown University in Spring 2024.
                        We were inspired to do this project because we were all fans
                        of the NBA and we wanted to learn how to use data science in
                        sports analytics.

            <h2>Research Process</h2>
            <p>
                A major challenge was trying to find a dataset that included
                both player performance metrics and team information.
                My team and I spent a lot of time finding datasets that had one or
                both of these features.
                We ultimately collected 2 datasets from multiple APIs and
                then combined them into one database that included all of the player
                data we needed.
                Our database includes various player performance indicators
                such as points per game, field goal percentage (FGP), defensive rebounds,
                and personal fouls.

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <p>
                1. Players with higher plus-minus scores
                tend to have higher FGP

                    Plus-minus score: difference between
                    points scored by player's team and opposing

                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>
                    <p>
                        This project deepened my understanding of how complex and nuanced data analysis can be. For
                        example, the correlation between plus-minus scores and field goal percentage was lower than
                        expected, revealing that many other factors — such as steals and offensive rebounds — influence
                        player performance metrics. I also learned that even with straightforward datasets, it’s
                        important to avoid overgeneralizing trends.
                        Overall, this project reinforced the importance of mindful and cautious analysis,
                        as I am to build AI and ML models that accurately reflect real-world data.

                    <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
                    <p> Another key takeaway was the importance of considering ethical implications in data analysis. In
                        sports analytics, racial bias remains a serious concern; for example, research by Foy and Roy
                        (2023) highlighted how lighter-skinned players are often praised for cognitive abilities, while
                        darker-skinned players are described more by physical traits. Although our dataset lacked
                        qualitative descriptions, we took care to mitigate bias by avoiding analysis that linked
                        physical attributes to race. As I continue working with AI and ML, maintaining ethical standards
                        will be crucial to creating fair, inclusive, and trustworthy systems. </p>
